# UI Automation Challenge

Your challenge is to implement UI Automation tests against TradeMe's job homepage (https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/jobs), using the cypress framework provided.

Keeping the perspective of our users in mind, build what you think are the most critical tests for the homepage, also you will be building tests against Production, so keep that in mind.


## Using the cypress Framework

### Dependencies

Tested with: [node](https://nodejs.org/) >= v12
### Set up
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine >= v12

Download the repository and install dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Cypress

```bash
npx cypress open
```

The cypress application should open, and you will be able to write / run test straight away.

### Writing Tests

There are guides [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test) for writing Cypress.io tests
